A language that excels <a href="https://www.java67.com/2022/02/top-5-courses-to-learn-java-online-for.html">Java</a>, which is often recognized as being much faster than Python. That it can even make the software run quicker if that is all you want it to do.</p> <p><em>Golang is the answer to all of these questions.</em></p> <p>Google has created this rationally built programming language. Although it is comparable to <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/11/top-5-courses-to-learn-c-programming-in.html">C</a> in terms of data consumption and storage, it differs in terms of syntactic type. </p> <p>It also incorporates best practices from the modern programming language which makes it ideal for backend and server-side development</p> <p>If you are wondering where is Golang used in real world then let me tell you that Go or Golang programming language is used in various domains such as <a href="https://www.java67.com/2022/12/10-projects-to-learn-web-development-in.html">web development</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-wireshark-courses-for-security-professionals-programmers-and-network-engineers-7144eb90a08d">network programming</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-30-system-design-interview-questions-and-problems-for-programmers-417e89eadd67">system programming</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/07/top-java-frameworks-for-Microservice-development.html">cloud-native development</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/7-best-courses-to-learn-artificial-intelligence-in-2020-26d59d62f6fe">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-machine-learning-and-data-science-certifications-and-training-courses-for-beginners-and-a6308497b764">machine learning</a>, and more.</p> <p>Since Golang is a highly performant and scalable language its also suitable for building large-scale distributed systems and microservices. </p> <p>Some of the popular companies that use Go include Google, Uber, Dropbox, Docker, and Netflix, to name a few. Its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use have made it a preferred choice among developers for building high-performance applications.</p> <p>By the way, if you can spend few bucks like $10 then I also suggest you to checkout <strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fgo-the-complete-developers-guide%2F">Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)</a></strong>  course on Udemy, it's a great course to start with Go programming in 2023. </p> <p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fgo-the-complete-developers-guide%2F"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u1lsRJPV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i1lznk7aspixdbnfcg77.png" alt="best course to learn Golang" width="760" height="409" /></a></p> <h3> 5 Best Free Golang Programming courses for Beginners in 2023 </h3> <p>Without any further delay, here I will show you the top courses to learn Go.</p> <h3> 1. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fgetgoing%2F">GetGoing: Introduction to Golang</a> </h3> <p>The "GetGoing: Introduction to Golang" is a free, beginner-level course on Udemy that aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the Go programming language to beginners. </p> <p>The course covers topics such as data types, control structures, functions, arrays, slices, maps, and pointers.
